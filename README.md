##Ricoh Printers Monitoring Template for Zabbix##
###Author: Corey Ramirez-Gomez###

Purpose: Monitor netowrk enabled/snmp enabled Ricoh model printers.

Setup: The Ricoh printers I set up to use this template required that I set a specific IP address to allow SNMP requests from. Login to the admin console of your printer to set the address from where the requests should be coming from and the community id.

Features: Monitors Ink levels, overall status, Tray levels, Cover statuses.
